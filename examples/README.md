# Arduino Examples

This directory contains a collection of Arduino sketches that demonstrate how to use the xTrainAPI with various model train control libraries.

## Examples

### NmraDcc_monitor

This example demonstrates how to use the `NmraDcc` library to monitor DCC commands on the track and translate them into `xTrainAPI` events. The events are then printed to the serial port in a human-readable format.

### MotorolaMaerklin_monitor

This example is a **non-functional placeholder** that demonstrates how to use the `laserlight/MotorolaMaerklin` library to monitor Motorola/Maerklin commands. The sketch will not compile without the `MotorolaMaerklin` library installed. It is intended to serve as a template for users who have access to this library.

## Usage

To use these examples, you will need to have the required libraries installed in your Arduino environment. You can install them from the Arduino Library Manager. Once the libraries are installed, you can open the sketches in the Arduino IDE, compile them, and upload them to your Arduino board.
